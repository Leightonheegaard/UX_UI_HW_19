            <h3>Wireframing</h3>
            <p>
              Proficient in wireframing tools like Figma, I possess a strong
              grasp of user-centered design principles. With experience in
              crafting wireframes for both web and mobile applications, I excel
              at translating user requirements into intuitive design solutions.
              Skilled in wireframe prototyping and iterative design processes, I
              contribute to projects by creating structured blueprints that
              guide the development of user-friendly interfaces. My portfolio
              showcases examples of my wireframing work, demonstrating my
              ability to enhance user experiences through thoughtful design
              solutions.

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>
              Proficient in conducting user research methodologies, I possess a
              keen understanding of user behavior and preferences. Experienced
              in gathering and analyzing user feedback through methods such as
              surveys, interviews, and usability testing, I leverage insights to
              inform design decisions and create intuitive digital experiences.
              With a user-centric approach, I excel at translating research
              findings into actionable design recommendations that enhance user
              satisfaction and engagement. My ability to apply user research
              principles ensures that design solutions meet the needs and
              expectations of target audiences effectively.

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>

              structures to enhance user navigation. Proficient in creating
              sitemaps and navigation systems, I prioritize user needs and
